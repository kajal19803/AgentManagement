✅ Project Title: CSTech Admin Panel – Agent Management and CSV Distribution (MERN Stack)

🎯 Objective  
To build a secure and scalable MERN stack admin panel that allows:  
Admin login with CSRF protection  
Agent creation, management, soft deletion & restoration  
Upload and structured distribution of contact lists from CSV/XLSX files  
Full login analytics and geoIP tracking  
Dark/light mode and branded dashboard UI  

⚙️ Implemented Features  

🔐 1. Admin Authentication  
- Secure login using Email & Password  
- CSRF token protection with SameSite cookie handling  
- JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies  
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force  
- Location-based login alerts sent on new IP  
- Protected routes via middleware (`auth`, `isAdmin`)  
- Logout and current user fetch (`/me`)  
- Login history analytics (`/login-analytics`)  

👥 2. Agent Management  
- Create agent with: Name, Email, Mobile Number, Country Code, Password  
- Strict validations (e.g., password strength, mobile format based on country)  
- Soft delete an agent  
- Restore a deleted agent  
- Search, pagination, and inclusion of deleted agents  
- Clear feedback messages on success/error  

📁 3. CSV/XLSX Upload & Distribution  
- Upload files: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls` (max 5MB)  
- Client-side & server-side file format validation  
- Data must include: FirstName, Phone, Notes  
- Tasks distributed evenly among 5 agents  
- Remainders handled sequentially  
- Data saved in MongoDB under timestamped batches  
- History of uploaded batches retrievable with pagination, search, filters  
- Each agent’s share displayed clearly  

🌙 4. Dark/Light Mode Toggle  
- Global `ThemeContext` via React  
- Toggle on Login & Dashboard pages  
- Tailwind `darkMode: 'class'` setup  
- Smooth transition animation  

🖼️ 5. Branding & UI Polish  
- Custom CSTech favicon and page title  
- Removed default React branding  
- Responsive layout and smooth UI interactions  
- Alerts and modals (e.g., file validation, confirm deletion)  

🛠️ Tech Stack  

| Layer     | Technology                  |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Frontend | React.js + TailwindCSS       |
| Backend  | Node.js + Express.js         |
| Database | MongoDB (Mongoose)           |
| Auth     | JWT + HttpOnly Cookies       |
| Upload   | Multer + Express Validator   |
| Security | Helmet, mongoSanitize, Rate Limit, CSRF |
| Analytics| IP-based login history, location detection |

🧪 Tested Scenarios  
✅ Invalid login: shows proper message  
✅ Invalid email/password: handled  
✅ New IP: triggers geoIP email alert  
✅ Token tampering: access denied  
✅ Upload invalid file: error shown  
✅ File > 5MB: upload rejected  
✅ Less than 5 agents: distribution still succeeds  
✅ Agent with duplicate email: error shown  
✅ Restore deleted agent: success confirmed  
✅ Dark/light mode persists across pages
